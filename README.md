# Spaceship Titanic

Welcome to the year 2912, where data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. A transmission has been received from four lightyears away, indicating a dire situation.

The Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago, carried almost 13,000 passengers on its maiden voyage from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the ship collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension, mirroring the fate of its namesake from 1000 years before.

To assist in rescue efforts and retrieve the lost passengers, participants are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

## Challenge

This project is part of a Kaggle competition. Participants are tasked with predicting which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.
